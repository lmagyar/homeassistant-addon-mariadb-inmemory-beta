# Home Assistant Custom Add-on: In-memory MariaDB

![Warning][warning_stripe]

> This is a **fork** of the [official add-on][official_addon]! See changes below.

> Updates are released:
> - when the official add-on changes (changes are merged), or 
> - when the DB schema changes in HA (`TRANSACTIONAL=0` has to be added to each table to NOT use to much memory).
> 
> So you usually don't need to update (and lose in-memory data):
> - the new functions from the official add-on usually are not used in an in-memory DB,
> - the DB schema changes in HA usually are not critical, HA will update the schema without any issue (adding/modifying columns, etc.)
> 
> __The only time you should update this add-on__ is when a new table added to the DB, when the in-memory version should add the `TRANSACTIONAL=0` parameter to the table to save memory. See the __Changelog__ under the __Info tab__ for this information.
> 
> But before updating the add-on, you can connect to it on port 3306 with eg. HeidiSQL, DBeaver, BeeKeeper-Studio and dump the content of the tables and reload them after restart. How to do it:
> - \> ha core stop
> - from the DB UI: save DB content __except__ `schema_changes` table (no table drop, no table create, only the content, a lof ot insert lines in the generated SQL file)
> - \> ha ad update 45207088_mariadb
> - from the DB UI: load DB content
> - \> ha core start

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Supervisor** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Click **Repositories** in the **...** menu at the top right corner, add `https://github.com/lmagyar/homeassistant-addon-mariadb-inmemory` as repository.
3. Find the "In-memory MariaDB" add-on and click it. If it doesn't show up, wait until HA refreshes the information about the add-on, or click **Reload** in the **...** menu at the top right corner.
4. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. Under the Configuration tab set the `logins` -> `password` field to something strong and unique.
2. Start the add-on.
3. Check the add-on log output to see the result.
4. Add `recorder` component to your Home Assistant configuration.

## Add-on Configuration

The MariaDB server add-on can be tweaked to your likings. This section
describes each of the add-on configuration options.

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
tmpfs:
  size: 200m
retention:
  enabled: true
databases:
  - homeassistant
logins:
  - username: homeassistant
    password: PASSWORD
  - username: read_only_user
    password: PASSWORD
rights:
  - username: homeassistant
    database: homeassistant
  - username: read_only_user
    database: homeassistant
    privileges:
      - SELECT
```

### Option: `tmpfs` (required)

This section defines the tmpfs filesystem.

### Option: `tmpfs.size` (required)

Specify an **upper limit** on the size of the in-memory filesystem. The size may have a **k**, **m**, or **g** suffix.

> During the first days regularly check the database size from eg. HeidiSQL, DBeaver, BeeKeeper-Studio. Or hardcore users can use Portainer add-on to get a console to this add-on's container (or without Portainer add-on SSH into the system, use `docker ps` and `docker exec -it 123456 /bin/bash`) and see the container's file-system directly, use `df` or `ls` to check free space and file sizes (database is located at `/tmp/databases`.
>
> **Note:** The database occupies more space on tmpfs than you see in the client. And it needs even more temporary space to `repack` tables after `purge` deleted rows.
>
> **Rule of thumb:** <minimum tmpfs size [MB]> = \<data stored daily [MB]\> * (\<purge_keep_days\> + 1) * 1.6 + 10[MB]
>
> **Note:** If you delete data from the database manually, use `OPTIMIZE TABLE states, events;` to decrease database file sizes also.

> ```sql
SELECT round(sum(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2)
INTO @database_size_in_MB
FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = database();
>
>SELECT min(time_fired), max(time_fired), timediff(max(time_fired), min(time_fired)),
  round(timestampdiff(minute, min(time_fired), max(time_fired)) / 1440, 2)
INTO @first_entry_in_UTC, @last_entry_in_UTC, @timespan, @timespan_in_days
FROM `events`;
>
>SELECT @first_entry_in_UTC AS first_entry_in_UTC, @last_entry_in_UTC AS last_entry_in_UTC,
  @timespan AS timespan, @timespan_in_days AS timespan_in_days,
  @database_size_in_MB AS database_size_in_MB, round(@database_size_in_MB / @timespan_in_days, 2) AS growth_per_day_in_MB,
  round((@database_size_in_MB / @timespan_in_days) * 8 * 1.6 + 10, 0) AS suggested_tmpfs_size_for_1_week_data_in_MB;
> ```
>
> </details>

### Option: `retention` (required)

This section defines the data retention parameters.

### Option: `retention.enabled` (optional)

Even this is an in-memory database, this option enables the possibility to export the `homeassistant` database's content before an update or restart and import the content when the add-on starts again.

**Note:**
- only the `homeassistant` database's content is exported and imported
- the database dump is located in the /data folder, so it is part of the normal backup process
- the database dump is **gzip-ed** before written to the storage to minimize SD-card wear
- after a power failure, when the add-on is restarted, it will import the last known exported database content

If enabled the add-on will
- export the database content before each backup and when stopped (restarted)
- import the database content when started (restarted)

If disabled the add-on will delete any previously saved database content when started (restarted).

If the optional value is not configured, the add-on will not create and will not delete any database content dump file.

### Option: `databases` (required)

Database name, e.g., `homeassistant`. Multiple are allowed.

> Use the default database name `homeassistant` to automatically create modified database schema when the add-on starts (default recorder schema, but without crash safety overhead).

### Option: `logins` (required)

This section defines a create user definition in MariaDB. [Create User][createuser] documentation.

### Option: `logins.username` (required)

Database user login, e.g., `homeassistant`. [User Name][username] documentation.

### Option: `logins.password` (required)

Password for user login. This should be strong and unique.

### Option: `rights` (required)

This section grant privileges to users in MariaDB. [Grant][grant] documentation.

### Option: `rights.username` (required)

This should be the same user name defined in `logins` -> `username`.

### Option: `rights.database` (required)

This should be the same database defined in `databases`.

### Option: `rights.privileges` (optional)

A list of privileges to grant to this user from [grant][grant] like `SELECT` and `CREATE`.
If omitted, grants `ALL PRIVILEGES` to the user. Restricting privileges of the user
that Home Assistant uses is not recommended but if you want to allow other applications
to view recorder data should create a user limited to read-only access on the database.

## Home Assistant Configuration

MariaDB will be used by the `recorder` and `history` components within Home Assistant. For more information about setting this up, see the [recorder integration][mariadb-ha-recorder] documentation for Home Assistant.

Example Home Assistant configuration:

```yaml
recorder:
  db_url: mysql://homeassistant:PASSWORD@45207088-mariadb/homeassistant?charset=utf8mb4
  auto_purge: false
  exclude:
    event_types:
      - call_service
  include:
    entities:
      - <the entity ids you really need>

automation:
  - alias: Auto purge with repack
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "04:12:00"
    action:
      service: recorder.purge
      data:
        keep_days: 7
        repack: true
```

**Note:** Change the `PASSWORD` string in the `db_url` field to the password you entered in the add-on configuration.

**Note:** The `45207088-mariadb` is the Hostname displayed on the add-on's Info tab.

> - Don't use `auto_purge`, regular auto purge does not repack the database files, they slowly grow because of fragmentation (new data will not fill perfectly the temporarily unused space of deleted/purged data). Instead call `recorder.purge` service with automation with `repack: true` service data.
> - Exclude all `call_service` entries from the database! These fill up the database really fast with all the parameters to the service calls, MQTT messages, etc.
>
> - See History or use eg. HeidiSQL, DBeaver, BeeKeeper-Studio to access the database and analyze it's content. Search for the entries you don't need, but fill up the database!
