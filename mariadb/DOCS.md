# Home Assistant Custom Add-on: In-memory MariaDB

![Warning][warning_stripe]

> This is a **fork** of the [official add-on][official_addon]! See changes below.
> 
> Updates are released when the official add-on changes (changes are merged).
>
> **Even this is an in-memory database, it can automatically export (from memory to SD card) the `homeassistant` database's content during backup, update, restart or even periodically, and can automatically import (from SD card to memory) the content when the add-on starts again**. The database dump is **gzip-ed** before written to the storage to minimize SD-card wear.
>
> Though it won't protect you from power failures. After a power failure, when the add-on is restarted, it will import the last known exported database content. So when eg. daily periodic export (from memory to SD card) is enabled, you will loose the latest sensory data within that day, but your long term statistics information will remain mostly intact.
 
> **Note:** If you update or restart the add-on, please stop HA core to avoid error messages that the database is not available (during plain backup, stopping HA core is not necessary). How to do it:
> - \> ha core stop
> - \> ha addons update 45207088_mariadb --backup
> - \> ha addons info 45207088_mariadb | grep -E '^version(:|_)'   # wait until the new version is installed
> - \> ha addons log 45207088_mariadb                              # wait until the add-on is fully started
> - \> ha core start

![Warning][warning_stripe]

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. In the **...** menu at the top right corner click **Repositories**, add `https://github.com/lmagyar/homeassistant-addon-mariadb-inmemory` as repository.
3. Find the "In-memory MariaDB" add-on and click it. If it doesn't show up, wait until HA refreshes the information about the add-on, or click **Reload** in the **...** menu at the top right corner.
4. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. Under the Configuration tab set the `logins` -> `password` field to something strong and unique.
2. Save the configuration.
3. Start the add-on.
4. Check the add-on log output to see the result.
5. Add `recorder` component to your Home Assistant configuration.

## Add-on Configuration

The MariaDB server add-on can be tweaked to your likings. This section
describes each of the add-on configuration options.

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
tmpfs:
  size: 200m
retention:
  enabled: true
  periodic: disabled
purge_statistics:
  period: monthly
  keep_periods: 6
  archive: false
databases:
  - homeassistant
logins:
  - username: homeassistant
    password: PASSWORD
  - username: read_only_user
    password: PASSWORD
rights:
  - username: homeassistant
    database: homeassistant
  - username: read_only_user
    database: homeassistant
    privileges:
      - SELECT
```

### Option: `tmpfs` (required)

This section defines the tmpfs filesystem.

### Option: `tmpfs.size` (required)

Specify an **upper limit** on the size of the in-memory filesystem. The size may have a **k**, **m**, or **g** suffix.

> ---
>
> **Important!**
>
> ---
>
> During the first days regularly check the database size from eg. HeidiSQL, DBeaver, BeeKeeper-Studio. Or hardcore users can use Portainer add-on to get a console to this add-on's container (or without Portainer add-on SSH into the system, use `docker exec -it addon_45207088_mariadb /bin/bash`) and see the container's file-system directly, use `df` or `ls` to check free space and file sizes (database is located at `/tmp/databases`.
>
> **Note:** The database occupies more space on tmpfs than you see in the client. And it needs even more temporary space to `repack` tables after `purge` deleted rows.
>
> **Rule of thumb:** <minimum tmpfs size [MB]> = \<data stored daily [MB]\> * (\<purge_keep_days\> + 1) * 1.6 + 10[MB]
>
> **Note:** If you delete data from the database manually, use `OPTIMIZE TABLE states, events;` to decrease database file sizes also.
>
> Use the query below to calculate database size requirements - Click to expand!
>
> <details>
>
> ```sql
SELECT round(sum(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2)
INTO @database_size_in_MB
FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = database();
>
>SELECT min(time_fired), max(time_fired), timediff(max(time_fired), min(time_fired)),
  round(timestampdiff(minute, min(time_fired), max(time_fired)) / 1440, 2)
INTO @first_entry_in_UTC, @last_entry_in_UTC, @timespan, @timespan_in_days
FROM `events`;
>
>SELECT @first_entry_in_UTC AS first_entry_in_UTC, @last_entry_in_UTC AS last_entry_in_UTC,
  @timespan AS timespan, @timespan_in_days AS timespan_in_days,
  @database_size_in_MB AS database_size_in_MB, round(@database_size_in_MB / @timespan_in_days, 2) AS growth_per_day_in_MB,
  round((@database_size_in_MB / @timespan_in_days) * 8 * 1.6 + 10, 0) AS suggested_tmpfs_size_for_1_week_data_in_MB;
> ```

> </details>

### Option: `retention` (required)

This section defines the data retention parameters.

### Option: `retention.enabled` (required)

Even this is an in-memory database, it can automatically export (from memory to SD card) the `homeassistant` database's content during backup, update, restart or even periodically, and can automatically import (from SD card to memory) the content when the add-on starts again. The database dump is gzip-ed before written to the storage to minimize SD-card wear.

**Note:**
- only the `homeassistant` database's content is exported and imported
- the database dump is located in the /data folder, so it is part of the normal Home Assistant backup process
- the database dump is **gzip-ed** before written to the storage to minimize SD-card wear
- after a power failure, when the add-on is restarted, it will import the last known exported database content

If enabled (default) the add-on will
- export the database content before each backup and when stopped (restarted)
- import the database content when started (restarted)

If disabled the add-on will delete any previously saved database content when started (restarted).

### Option: `retention.periodic` (required)

This option helps to minimize data loss in case of power failure by periodically exporting the `homeassistant` database's content.

Possible values:
- disabled (default)
- hourly (periodically export at each hour 00 minute)
- daily (periodically export at 02:00h)
- weekly (periodically export at 03:00h on each Saturday)
- monthly (periodically export at 05:00h on the first day of each month)

**Note:** This option exports the database content from memory to SD card, but doesn't create a complete Home Assistant backup nor uploads it to anywhere. In case you use a periodic Home Assistant backup solution, you don't need to enable this periodic retention option, only enable the retention functionality above, because exporting database content is part of the add-on's backup.

### Option: `purge_statistics` (required)

This section defines the parameters for statics data purging.

Home Assistant never deletes old statistics data, so the database size can overgrow the memory limit. 

### Option: `purge_statistics.period` (required)

Specifies how frequently should the statistics data be purged.

Possible values:
- daily (periodically purge at 02:00h)
- weekly (periodically purge at 03:00h on each Saturday)
- monthly (periodically purge at 05:00h on the first day of each month) (default)

### Option: `purge_statistics.keep_periods` (required)

The number of periods to keep in database after a purge.

Default is 6 months.

### Option: `purge_statistics.archive` (required)

Whether export the data before deletion.

Default is disabled.

**Note:** The export location is in the `/share/purged-statistics` folder, that can be acessed with eg. the Samba share add-on. This folder is also part of the full backup of Home Assistant, so without moving these exported old data anywhere, they will be part of the Home Assistant backup (not the add-on's backup, these are deleted from the database, these are archive values, not belonging to the add-on anymore).

### Option: `databases` (required)

Database name, e.g., `homeassistant`. Multiple are allowed.

> ---
>
> **Important!**
>
> ---
>
> Use the default database name `homeassistant` to automatically backup database content and alter schema to remove crash safety overhead.

### Option: `logins` (required)

This section defines a create user definition in MariaDB. [Create User][createuser] documentation.

### Option: `logins.username` (required)

Database user login, e.g., `homeassistant`. [User Name][username] documentation.

### Option: `logins.password` (required)

Password for user login. This should be strong and unique.

### Option: `rights` (required)

This section grant privileges to users in MariaDB. [Grant][grant] documentation.

### Option: `rights.username` (required)

This should be the same user name defined in `logins` -> `username`.

### Option: `rights.database` (required)

This should be the same database defined in `databases`.

### Option: `rights.privileges` (optional)

A list of privileges to grant to this user from [grant][grant] like `SELECT` and `CREATE`.
If omitted, grants `ALL PRIVILEGES` to the user. Restricting privileges of the user
that Home Assistant uses is not recommended but if you want to allow other applications
to view recorder data should create a user limited to read-only access on the database.

## Home Assistant Configuration

MariaDB will be used by the `recorder` and `history` components within Home Assistant. For more information about setting this up, see the [recorder integration][mariadb-ha-recorder] documentation for Home Assistant.

Example Home Assistant configuration:

```yaml
recorder:
  db_url: mysql://homeassistant:PASSWORD@45207088-mariadb/homeassistant?charset=utf8mb4
  db_max_retries: 20
  db_retry_wait: 15
  auto_purge: false
  exclude:
    event_types:
      - call_service
  include:
    entities:
      - <the entity ids you really need>

logger:
  default: warning
  filters:
    homeassistant.components.recorder.core:
      - 'Error during connection setup: .MySQLdb.OperationalError. .2002' # Can't connect to MySQL server on '45207088_mariadb'
      - 'Error during connection setup: .MySQLdb.OperationalError. .1130' # Host '172.30.32.1' is not allowed to connect to this MariaDB server
      - 'Error during connection setup: .MySQLdb.OperationalError. .1044' # Access denied for user 'homeassistant'@'%' to database 'homeassistant'

automation:
  - alias: Auto purge with repack
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "04:12:00"
    action:
      service: recorder.purge
      data:
        keep_days: 7
        repack: true
```

**Note:** Change the `PASSWORD` string in the `db_url` field to the password you entered in the add-on configuration.

**Note:** The `45207088-mariadb` is the Hostname displayed on the add-on's Info tab.

> - Don't use `auto_purge`, regular auto purge does not repack the database files, they slowly grow because of fragmentation (new data will not fill perfectly the temporarily unused space of deleted/purged data). Instead call `recorder.purge` service with automation with `repack: true` service data.
> - Exclude all `call_service` entries from the database! These fill up the database really fast with all the parameters to the service calls, MQTT messages, etc.
> - Let the recorder to wait for the database to import the last known database content from SD card to memory during Home Assistant startup (that can take up to a few minutes on large databases), use the recorder's `db_max_retry` and `db_retry_wait` paramaters to wait for max. 5 minutes, and use the logger's `filters` parameter to filter out the recorder's error messages when it waits for the database to be ready.
> - See History or use eg. HeidiSQL, DBeaver, BeeKeeper-Studio to access the database and analyze it's content. Search for the entries you don't need, but fill up the database!
